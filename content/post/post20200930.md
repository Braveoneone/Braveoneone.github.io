numastat to collect the memory consumption

# Displays Memory statistics for each NUMA(Non-Uniform Memory Architecture) node

$ numastat

                               node0

    numa_hit                 2419687

    numa_miss                      0

    numa_foreign                   0

    interleave_hit             17197

    local_node               2419687

    other_node                     0


Output items

numa_hit: The expected memory was successfully allocated on this node

numa_miss: Memory is allocated on this node, but the process uses a different node. Each numa_miss has a numa_foreign on another node

numa_foreign: The memory for the new node is actually allocated to other nodes, and each numa_foreign has a numa_miss on another node

interleave_hit: Memory that is expected to be successfully interleaved on this node

local_node: The memory allocated on a node when a process is running on the node

other_node: The memory allocated when a process is running on another node


Parameters

o	-c： Based on the data content when the table shrinks the width of the column, the memory is rounded to megabytes, which is helpful for systems that display multiple NUMA nodes more densely

pcm-memory command to collect the bandwidth from hardware counters.


# Numa
NUMA (Non Uniform Memory Access Architecture) technology enables many servers to operate as a single system, while retaining the advantages of small systems that are easy to program and manage. Non-uniform Memory Access (NUMA) is a kind of computer memory design for multiprocessor. The memory access time depends on the memory location of the processor. Under NUMA, a processor can access its own local memory faster than non-local memory (the place of the memory to the processor or memory shared between another processor).

 

# Optane
Chinese name "Aoteng", is a new ultra-high speed memory technology, compatible with NVMe storage protocol. Optane is compatible with the NVMe (Non-volatile memory) storage protocol, which Apple already uses in some of its Macbooks.
